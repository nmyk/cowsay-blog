/ The modern corporate office, if it were \
| logistically perfect--that is, if its   |
| architecture were such that employees   |
| were always either moving in a          |
| controlled manner or motionless and     |
| isolated; if management could, in a     |
| passive and unobtrusive way, monitor    |
| every employee at all times; if every   |
| employee's daily schedule followed a    |
| perfectly rigid timetable--it would be  |
| a prison.                               |
|                                         |
| So would a perfect school. So would a   |
| perfect hospital.                       |

/ The best opening sentence to a novel is \

| "The sky above the port was the color   |
| of television, tuned to a dead          |
| channel." But to go into why it's the   |
| best would be somewhat beside the       |
| point, and may even ruin it for you.    |
